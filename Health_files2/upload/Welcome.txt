##DARNA Health Intelligence v2.3- An open source intiative - self custody of your health data
##Early stage. Beta and under development and isnt secure. Please take all steps to safeguard your data. 

What is this project?
======================
DARNA. HI v2.3 is a Forward looking project.

Key words: Self Hosted, LINUX, python, Open Source.

Vision: This will be an open source, linux based personal Health coach which by the way allows self custody data.

We are getting ready for the day when powerful Language models would run locally on your device and you can ask it in a very Privacy centered questions very specific to your health . In Darnahi v2.3 a language model (llama 1B) is being used to process personal health data and provide answers to questions specific to an individual's health situation. Additionally, natural language preprocessing (NLP) techniques are being used, along with a retrieval augmented architecture (RAG) to process and understand the health data by the local LLM.

In future we hope to have a trained lightweight large language model (LLM) being employed to interpret the processed data and generate relevant health intents or responses tailored to an individual's queries about their health. To summarize Darnahi aims to leverage advanced language AI capabilities to give personalized health insights and recommendations by analyzing someone's specific health information and answering their questions in that context.

The core components are NLP for understanding natural language, a RAG model for retrieving and processing relevant data, and a local LLM that ties it together by mapping the data to the queries and providing contextualized health-related output.

This project is an Free and open-source software that helps bring together your health data that is currently saved in different places like electronic health records, fitness apps, and wearable devices. We wish to provide a way to aggregate your health data. One stop to bring all your health data together on your secure computer at home. When you visit a new doctor, you can choose to share your encrypted health data with them on demand through QR code, email, link etc. This way, you have full custody of your health data and can decide who to share it with and what to do with it.
