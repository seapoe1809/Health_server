##DARNA Healthy Intent v2- An open source intiative - self custody of your health data
##Early stage. Beta and under development and isnt secure. Please take all steps to safeguard your data. 

What is this project?
======================
DARNA. HI v2 is a Forward looking project.

We are getting ready for the day the superior Language models would run locally on your device and you can ask it in a very Privacy centered way to give its 'Health-intents'(c) on your medical information . This project is an open-source software that helps bring together your health data that is currently saved in different places like electronic health records, fitness apps, and wearable devices. 

Now we hope with this software, you can bring all your health data together in one place on your computer at home. When you visit a new doctor, you can choose to share your health data with them on demand through email, link etc. This way, you have full custody of your health data and can decide who to share it with.


I created this project because I had trouble moving my own health data when I switched healthcare providers. As someone who works in the healthcare space, I see that current EHR solutions make it difficult to port your data, even though there are regulatory requirements to do so. It's frustrating to see that some institutions still rely on fax and scan to move data around, which shows how outdated and hidden these data porting techniques are. Given this pain point, I also see an exciting oppportunity with LLM's. I look forward to the day when superior Language models will run on your device at home.

This is version 2 of the project, and I anticipate that there will be many more iterations before it takes a good form. But my goal is to make it easier for people to take ownership of their health data and store it in one place on their own computer. They can shoose to interact with LLM's with their deidentified data if they wis. This way, they can decide who to share it with and have more control over their own health.
