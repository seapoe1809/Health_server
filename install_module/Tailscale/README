This module works along with DarnaV2 at : https://github.com/seapoe1809/Health_server

Installing repo this will allow you to add Tailscale to it. Tailscale allows you to access your Darna.HI server remotely outside your wifi network.
This is highly recommended as it allows you to access your running laptop remotely.

What is Tailscale?

Tailscale is a free and open source service, based on WireGuard®, that helps users build no-hassle virtual private networks. Once you’ve created a Tailscale network (tailnet), you can securely access services and devices on that tailnet from anywhere in the world.


With a personal tailnet, you can:
a) Remote access

b) Add devices to your tailnet, to access them from anywhere in the world.
Filter DNS

c) Block malicious traffic, ads, and trackers to help secure your network with NextDNS.
Encrypt traffic

Route and encrypt internet traffic through an Exit Node on your tailnet.

AFTER LOGGING INTO TAILSCALE
You will get IP address. Add :3001 to the IP address and you will be at login page. The save to home screen. If needed, replace the variables/variable.py ip_address with the IP address from Tailscale
