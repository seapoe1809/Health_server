    Description: "Yacht local is a web interface for managing docker containers and allows one-click deployments of dockerized applications. Think of it like a decentralized app store for servers that anyone can make packages for. The app is maintained by https://yacht.sh. The writer of Darna.HI isnt involved in its creation/ maintenance. Please not the Yacht Dock is still in development process and might be glitchy at times. Also refresh of page is best done with 'browser refresh'. To add apps to download, click on 'Resources', then 'Templates', '+'. Add title of 'App_Store' and paste URL 'https://rawgithubusercontent.com/master/Template/yacht.json' and 'Save'."
