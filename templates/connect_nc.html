<h3 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: black; font-style: bold; text-align: center;">Connect other devices using QR Code </h3>
<p id="qrcode">
 </p> <p>
This guide allows you to connect other devices to your Darna Server. It does require you to have camera enabled to scan QR codes:
 </p> <p>
 1.  Open "camera app" on your iOS or Android. When pointed to QR code at top of screen it should give you a link to click on. Click on link.
 </p> <p>
 2.  On the bottom ribbon of browser window on your iOS device, click on 'â®¹'. Then choose 'Add to home screen'. 
  </p> <p>
 3.  This link will now allow you to launch the server directly from your home screen when connected to local WIFI where the server is enabled as a WebApp.
  </p> <p>
 4.  To change the QR code, go to Health_server/variables/variable.py. Edit the IP address.

<h3 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: black; font-style: bold;text-align: center;">What are the tags in 'Upload' and what are the directories for?</h3>
<p id="upload">
 </p> <p>
Upload button allows you to upload files from any other device or phone to upload files to the Darna.HI server. With drop down menu you could either tag it as a 'Health File' or a 'Regular File'.
 </p> <p>
 1. Health File: Any health document you would like to save for obvious reasons. Tagging it allows it to be catalogued to the right subdirectory. The Health subdirectories are 'summary' and 'ocr_files'. So that when analyzed, included in RAG Daarnabot or zipped it is part of the packet. 
 </p> <p>
 2.  Regular Files: Are any non health file that you would like to store on your health server but isnt a HealthFile. It gets stored in the main folder but untagged. This allows you to store other files of your choice.
  </p> <p>
                 In future 'Export.zip' file containing your iOS health kit is available in 'Upload' directory and tagged a 'Regular File', it will unzip that file, initate Grafana and Influxdb, populate influxdb with your records.
  </p>
  <p>
 3. The 'summary' folder is where you 'Health' tagged files are stored. When you want to make a secure zip file to share, all the files in 'summary' get zipped. The default password is '2023'. You could change it in the darna.py code if you wish. It is hardcoded for obvious reasons.
  </p>
  <p>
 4. The 'ocr_files' folder is where your 'Health' tagged files of pdf, jpg, png and even json ext are stored. When Darnabot Analyze is run it OCR's the files and stores it as a deidentified text dump in Darna_tesseract subdirectory. It is used to generate RAG for Darnabot, Wordclouds.
  </p>
   <p>
 5. The 'Darna_tesseract' folder is where your 'Analyze' card stores relevant files. Files such as deidentified records, Personalized Health intents, wordclouds, NLP generated jsons are stored.
  </p>
 6. You could explore the ocr_files and Darna_Tesseract files from Darnabot, via 'RUN AI' tab and click on dropdown 'EXPLORE AI FILES'.

<h3 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: black; font-style: bold;text-align: center;">What does 'RUN AI' in Darnabot do?.</h3>
<p id="rsync">
 </p> <p>
 'RUN AI' has many functions mashed into one. Once you enter your age, sex (imported from Chartit), and words to de-identify separated by "|" It generates a list of recommended medical screening information for your age based on USPSTF guidelines.
 </p> <p>
 It uses OCR to extract data from your uploaded files It runs simple NLP to get medical data organized by headings. It then vectorizes and chunks up the data It creates a word cloud of your recent uploaded data
 </p> <p>
It creates a vectorized database for the local LLM This allows the LLM to access your data and provide personalized answers to your medical questions.

</p> <p>
<h3 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: black; font-style: bold;text-align: center;">How about the 'Chart it' Card? </h3>
</p> <p>
</p> <p>
It allows you to enter your past medical history and update your list of medications in a standard FHIR R4 format. This information gets stored in the 'summary' folder. When you share an encrypted zip file with your healthcare provider, they can access your basic demographics, allergies, past medical history and current medication list in a format compatible with electronic medical records (EMRs). Additionally, it creates a database from your entered information that the vectorizer can use when you ask health-related questions to the local language model.
</p> <p>
So in summary, it lets you securely share your medical details with providers while also building a personalized database to enable the AI to provide tailored health information based on your specific medical history.
  </p> <p>
<h3 style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: black; font-style: bold;text-align: center;">What is symptom Logger in Darnabot? </h3>
</p> <p>
</p> <p>
It allows you to log your symptoms that are stored in the database and also creates a PDF to be stored in the 'Summary' folder and 'Ocr files'. The PDF files can then be used to generate RAG database for Darnabot and be shared with your medical provider if needed. There is also a 'Generate' option that leverages local AI to write the note for you.
</p> <p>
So in summary, it lets you securely share your medical details with providers while also building a personalized database to enable the AI to provide tailored health information based on your specific medical history.

<p id="pi">
 </p> <p>
 We support Monero!
 </p> <p> 
In the realm of financial privacy, the use of cryptocurrencies like Monero or Bitcoin can play a role in enhancing users' security.
