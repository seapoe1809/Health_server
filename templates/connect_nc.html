        This guide allows you to connect other devices to your Darna Server. It does require you to have camera enabled to scan QR codes:
    </p> <p>
    1.  Open "camera app" on your iOS or Android. When pointed to QR code at top of screen it should give you a link to click on. Click on link.
    </p> <p>
    2.  On the bottom ribbon of browser window on your iOS device, click on '‚Æπ'. Then choose 'Add to home screen'. 
    </p> <p>
 3.  This link will now allow you to launch the server directly from your home screen when connected to local WIFI where the server is enabled as a WebApp.
    </p> <p>
 4.  To change the QR code, go to Health_server/variables/variable.py. Edit the IP address.

Upload button allows you to upload files from any other device or phone to upload files to the Darna.HI server. With drop down menu you could either tag it as a 'Health File' or a 'Regular File'.
 </p> <p>
 1. Health File: Any health document you would like to save for obvious reasons. Tagging it allows it to be catalogued to the right subdirectory. The Health subdirectories are 'summary' and 'ocr_files'. So that when analyzed, included in RAG Daarnabot or zipped it is part of the packet. 
 </p> <p>
 2.  Regular Files: Are any non health file that you would like to store on your health server but isnt a HealthFile. It gets stored in the main folder but untagged. This allows you to store other files of your choice.
  </p> <p>
 3. The 'summary' folder is where you 'Health' tagged files are stored. When you want to make a secure zip file to share, all the files in 'summary' get zipped. The default password is **'2023'**. You could change it in the darna.py code if you wish. It is hardcoded for obvious reasons.
  </p> <p>
 4. The 'ocr_files' folder is where your 'Health' tagged files of pdf, jpg, png and even json ext are stored. When Darnabot Analyze is run it OCR's the files and stores it as a deidentified text dump in Darna_tesseract subdirectory. It is used to generate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for Darnabot (for personalized responses) and Wordclouds.
  </p> <p>
 5. The 'Darna_tesseract' folder is where your 'Analyze' run stores relevant files. Files such as deidentified records, Personalized Health intents, wordclouds, NLP generated jsons are stored.
  </p> <p>
 6. You could explore the AI generated files in 'ocr_files' and 'Darna_Tesseract' files from Darnabot, via 'RUN AI' tab and then click on dropdown 'EXPLORE AI FILES'.

                <p>RUN AI is our advanced artificial intelligence feature that helps process and analyze your health data automatically, providing personalized insights and recommendations for you.
</p><p>
'RUN AI' has many cleansing, analysis functions mashed into one. User needs to add words to de-identify separated by "|" if additional words needs to be removed. 
  </p> <p>
Once run, it retrieves age, sex (from Chartit card), extracts, cleanses and generates a list of personalized medical information for your age based on USPSTF guidelines.
 </p> <p>
 It uses OCR to extract data from your uploaded files. It then runs simple NLP to get medical data organized by headings. It then vectorizes and chunks up the data to create a RAG database. 
  </p> <p>
It then creates a word cloud of your recent uploaded data.
 </p> <p>
The created vectorized database allows the local LLM to access your data and provide personalized answers to your questions.
